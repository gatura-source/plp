Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves the application of engineering principles to software creation, ensuring that the software is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of users.

software engineering is essential for the successful development and maintenance of software systems. Its importance in the technology industry lies in its ability to provide structured approaches to software creation, ensuring that software products are reliable, efficient, and capable of meeting the evolving needs of users and businesses.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- From machine code to human readable text. This was made possible by the first compiler that could translate human readable text to machine code
- Punch cards to machine code - Before software writing was a real tihing, punch cards were used as software which would take a lot of time to process
- Multiuser timesharing systems. Unix comes along and makes it possible for more than a single user to use and access a computer at the same time


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- **Planning**: This initial phase involves defining the scope and purpose of the project.

- **Analysis**: During the analysis phase, detailed requirements are gathered and analyzed. This involves working closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and documenting functional and non-functional requirements. The outcome is a clear and comprehensive requirements specification.

- **Design**: In the design phase, the software architecture and system design are created based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase. 

- **Implementation (or Coding)**: This phase involves the actual coding and development of the software.

- **Testing**: Once the software is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects. 

- **Deployment**: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. may also include user training and documentation.

- **Maintenance**: The final phase of the SDLC is maintenance, which involves ongoing support and updates to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall method is more static where a team can only advance to the next stage if and only if a previous stage is complete while agile is more dynamic
- Waterfall method is set for more restrictive environment with little to no room for change while agile embracse changes along teh development phase
- Both methods do require feedback from the customer
- Both methods can be used in creating a software
- Waterfall is ideal for a critical system while agile is ideal for a engaging software where customer and user feedback is key 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer is tasked with creating, maintaining and updating a software product
- QA engineer ensures that a software product meets the specifications and is bug-free
- Project manager is tasked with communicating requirements, setting the goals and deadlines for a software product 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs e.g Visual Studio Code streamline the development process of a software
- IDEs intergrate with version control system which makes it easy to ipdate and maintain code
- IDEs provide testing and debugging tools for the software development phase
- VCS e.g gitlab allow easy deployment of code 
- VCS also allow easy track of system version and changes made to a software
- VCS allow easy collaboration among software developers


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Communicatiiopn of requirements from stakeholders. This can be overcoamed by making the software cycle more engaing with inclusion of stakeholders throughout the whole journey of the deveoplement prcoess
- Legacy code maintanance - Maintaining legacy code can be overcomed by constantly keeping software up to date with current trends in software enginerring
- Data Privacy. The solution is ensuring that a software meets regional and internal data protection policies eg GDPR
- Meeting Deadlines - By setting clear and concise goals, it is very easy to meet a deadline 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit testing is testing that is aimed to ensure that each part of a software (each unit ) works as expected
- Integration testing is testing software to ensure that all parts of the software can integrate with each other without any complications
- System testing is testing aimed at ensuring that the software can execute on the target systems without errors
- Acceptance testing is testing a software against the requirements(functiona nd non-functional)


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting prompts or questions to get best answers from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
